/**
 * Regression test: Worker.kill() used to only SIGKILL the single
 * worker-script.js PID (`this.process.kill('SIGKILL')`). In production,
 * the handler a worker runs (e.g. release checks) shell.execs subprocesses
 * with `detached: true` (node-backend.ts, so THAT subprocess's own timeout
 * kill can clean up its own subtree in isolation) — which means those
 * subprocesses are NOT members of the worker's own process group. When the
 * worker itself was killed (e.g. an execution timeout), those detached
 * subprocesses — and anything THEY spawned — were silently orphaned and
 * kept running indefinitely. Confirmed in production: ~10 accumulated
 * orphaned worker-script.js/install processes across failed runs.
 *
 * This is a REAL process test (not mocked): a fixture worker script
 * (hanging-worker-with-child.mjs) reproduces the exact shape — on
 * 'execute' it spawns its own `detached: true` grandchild and then hangs —
 * so the test proves Worker.kill() actually reaches a process that
 * deliberately escaped its process group, the same way the real
 * `release clean install` subprocess does.
