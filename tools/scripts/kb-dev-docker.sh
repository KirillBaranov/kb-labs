# kb-dev-docker.sh — `kb-dev` proxy that runs inside the platform container.
#
# Used by CI where the runner sits on the GH Actions host but the platform
# (and its kb-dev binary) lives in a sibling Docker container. Set this
# script as the runner's `KB_DEV_BIN` and the runner stays unaware of
# containers — it just calls `kb-dev`, the wrapper translates paths and
# forwards to the container.
#
# Path translation: any positional arg that starts with KB_HOST_E2E
# (default: `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/e2e` or `<repo-with-.git>/e2e`) is rewritten
# to start with KB_CONTAINER_E2E (default: `/workspace/e2e-host`). This
# matches the bind mount declared in `e2e/docker-compose.yml`.
#
# Environment:
#   KB_HOST_E2E         host path to repo's `e2e/` directory
#                       (default: `${GITHUB_WORKSPACE:-<repo>}/e2e`)
#   KB_CONTAINER_E2E    mount path inside the container
#                       (default: `/workspace/e2e-host`)
#   KB_CONTAINER_WORKDIR  workdir for `docker compose exec`
#                         (default: `/workspace/kb-e2e`)
#   KB_DOCKER_TARGET    docker compose service name (default: `platform`)
