# Q2 2026 Roadmap

> **Quarter Focus:** Studio Enhancement - Building pluggable architecture with Studio plugin system

## Quarter Context

**Strategic Focus:** Q2 2026 focuses on Studio enhancements with pluggable architecture. This is a critical step in enabling extensibility and setting the foundation for permissions, roles, and plugin sandbox in later quarters.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Studio Pluggable Architecture**: Design and implement plugin system for Studio
- **Plugin Architecture**: Add plugin support to Core/CLI
- **Profile Extraction**: Convert profiles to plugins
- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automated plugin management

## 📋 Deliverables

### Studio Pluggable Architecture
- [ ] Design Studio plugin system architecture
- [ ] Create plugin API and interfaces for Studio
- [ ] Implement plugin registry and discovery for Studio
- [ ] Plan plugin sandbox architecture (for Q4)

### Plugin System
- [ ] Add plugin support to Core/CLI
- [ ] Design plugin API and interfaces
- [ ] Create plugin registry and discovery

### Profile Plugins
- [ ] Extract profiles as plugins (frontend-vue, frontend-react, backend-node)
- [ ] Document plugin development guidelines
- [ ] Create plugin testing framework

### Automation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for plugins
- [ ] Implement plugin versioning
- [ ] Create plugin marketplace foundation

### Version 2.0 Continuation
- [ ] Continue stabilization work on packages
- [ ] Apply plugin architecture to Studio enhancements
