## What each workflow does

### CI (`ci.yml`)
**Purpose:** lint, type-check, unit tests, and coverage for the entire monorepo.
**When:** every push to `main` (with `paths-ignore`); manual dispatch.
**Skips:** `**/*.md`, `docs/**`, `.claude/**`, `.vscode/**`, `.idea/**`, `.editorconfig`, `LICENSE`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. `sites/**` is **not** skipped — site code is part of the monorepo and is linted/typed.
**Concurrency:** `ci-main-${{ github.ref }}`, `cancel-in-progress: true`. New commit on main cancels in-flight CI.
**Typical duration:** ~17 min.

### CI (PR) (`ci-pr.yml`)
**Purpose:** same checks as `CI` but scoped to the PR's diff base for `--affected` modes. Runs on every PR update.
**When:** PR `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`.
**Concurrency:** per PR number; pushing to a PR cancels the prior CI (PR) run.

### E2E Platform Tests (`e2e-platform.yml`)
**Purpose:** end-to-end platform tests via `kb-devkit run e2e` across 8 domains. See [ADR-0017](./adr/0017-e2e-pipeline-sharding-and-caching.md) for architecture, [ADR-0019](./adr/0019-pr-e2e-gate.md) for the PR-gate decision.
**When:**
- **Every PR push** (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`) with `paths-ignore`.
- Every push to `main` (with `paths-ignore`) — safety net.
- After every successful "Release Binaries" run (smoke test on the published binaries).
- Weekly Monday 09:00 UTC (canary).
- Manual dispatch.

**Skips:** same as CI plus `sites/**`. Marketing site is deployed by `deploy.yml` and doesn't run on the platform.
**Concurrency:** `e2e-platform-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}`, `cancel-in-progress: true`. Successive pushes inside the same PR (typical agent flow) cancel earlier runs, so the cost is one full run per PR settle point, not per push.
**Structure:** 8-shard matrix (one per `@kb-labs/e2e-<suite>`) + aggregator. Branch protection points at the aggregator's `Platform E2E` check.
**Typical duration:** ~8 min wall-clock; per shard ~5–8 min.

### Cache policy

PR callers use the `read-write` cache mode: kb-devkit's addressable build CAS
and BuildKit's GHA layer cache may be restored and updated. Packed packages and
Verdaccio storage are never restored from a cross-run cache; the prepare job
passes an immutable same-run bundle to its shards.

Main, scheduled, and release-triggered E2E runs use `off`: they rebuild the
platform, npm tarballs, Verdaccio registry, and images from source. This is the
authoritative verification path. See [ADR-0038](./adr/0038-ci-cache-policy-and-authoritative-builds.md)
for fingerprints, metrics, and the warm-vs-cold audit.

### Post-publish Smoke (`e2e-user-journey.yml`)
**Purpose:** verify delivery of the public installer and published artifacts in
a clean container. Full source/CI user journeys run against Verdaccio in
`e2e-platform.yml` and the launcher E2E workflow; this job is the final public
artifact smoke and intentionally catches npm/GitHub Release packaging errors.
**When:** after successful binary or npm delivery, weekly Monday 08:00 UTC,
or manual dispatch.
**Typical duration:** ~5–15 min.

### Deploy (`deploy.yml`)
**Purpose:** declarative delivery to staging/prod via `kb-deploy`. See [ADR-0014](./adr/0014-declarative-delivery-and-fleet-distribution.md).
**When:** push to `main` *only* if it touches one of:
- `sites/web/**`, `core/**`, `shared/**`, `tools/kb-deploy/**`
- specific adapters: `openai`, `redis`, `sqlite`, `pino`, `fs`, `log-sqlite`, `log-ringbuffer`, `eventbus-cache`
- `plugins/gateway/**`, `.kb/deploy.yaml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Manual dispatch with optional `target` input.

**Reuses:** `KB Deploy — Apply` via `workflow_call`.
**Typical duration:** ~10 min.

### Build and deliver candidate workflows
The workflow engine supplies an immutable release intent to
`release-build-candidate.yml`. That workflow builds packages and binaries once,
seals the unified release-index and uploads one candidate bundle. The engine
then invokes `release-deliver-candidate.yml`, which verifies the bundle digest,
publishes exact bytes and runs the post-publish launcher journey.

Neither workflow chooses versions, resolves compatibility, performs a second
build, or has a legacy tag-triggered fallback. Stable promotion is another
workflow-engine transition using the same candidate ID and bundle.

### CodeQL ("Push on main")
**Purpose:** static-analysis security scanning.
**When:** GitHub-managed "default setup" — runs on every push to `main` and on PRs.
**Where to configure:** Settings → Code security → CodeQL. Not a workflow YAML in this repo.
**Trade-off:** moving to weekly cron saves ~5 min/push but trades latency on catching new vulnerabilities. See [docs/ci-budget.md](./ci-budget.md) for the UI step.

### KB Deploy — Apply (`kb-deploy-apply.yml`)
**Purpose:** reusable workflow for `kb-deploy plan` + `apply`. Called via `workflow_call` from other workflows (e.g. `deploy.yml` in this repo, or downstream consumer repos).
**No direct triggers** — only invoked by callers.

## State inspection

### Badges (README)
The README top renders main-branch status badges for **CI**, **E2E Platform Tests**, and **Deploy**. Green/red at a glance.

### Terminal (`scripts/ci-status.sh`)
```bash
./scripts/ci-status.sh           # latest run per workflow on main (✅/❌)
./scripts/ci-status.sh 24h       # what ran in the last 24h + compute spend
./scripts/ci-status.sh 7d        # 7-day pass/fail summary
```

### GitHub Actions UI
- **Skipped runs** (matched by `paths-ignore`) do not appear in the Actions tab at all. Audit by checking `paths-ignore:` blocks in the workflow YAML directly.
- **Cancelled runs** (from concurrency cancellation) **do** appear, marked "cancelled". Hover to see which subsequent commit pre-empted them.

### Branch protection (the required check)
For `main`, only the aggregator job is required: **Platform E2E**. The 8 individual shards (`Platform E2E / services`, `… / workflows`, etc.) are visible in the PR/commit view for triage and re-run, but only the aggregator gates merges.

**Required checks (set in `Settings → Branches → main`):**
- `Platform E2E` — the aggregator from `e2e-platform.yml` matrix
- `CI (PR)` jobs — `Build Go tools`, `Build TS (devkit)`, `Deps (syncpack)`, `Plugin structure`, `lint`, `type-check`, `test`

With these required, a PR cannot merge until both `CI (PR)` and the PR-triggered `Platform E2E` are green. See [ADR-0019](./adr/0019-pr-e2e-gate.md).

## Common scenarios

| What I push | What runs |
|---|---|
| `README.md` only (to main) | CodeQL only |
| `docs/**/*.md` only (to main) | CodeQL only |
| `sites/web/**` only (to main) | Deploy + CI + CodeQL (E2E skipped) |
| `plugins/workflow/**` (to main) | CI + E2E Platform Tests + CodeQL |
| `core/runtime/**` (to main) | CI + E2E Platform Tests + Deploy + CodeQL |
| `.github/workflows/e2e-platform.yml` (to main) | CI + E2E Platform Tests + CodeQL (the workflow file itself isn't in `paths-ignore`) |
| Any non-doc/-site code in a **PR** | CI (PR) + E2E Platform Tests (full matrix, branch protection required) |
| Doc-only / sites-only in a **PR** | CI (PR) only — E2E skipped by `paths-ignore` |
| `v0.5.0-binaries` tag pushed | Release Binaries → triggers Post-publish Smoke + E2E Platform Tests |
| `kb commit` / `git commit` on a release | Whatever the diff matches above |
| Three commits in 30 seconds (PR or main) | Only the last one's CI + E2E run fully; earlier two are cancelled (visible in UI) |

## When things go wrong

1. **Main turned red unexpectedly.** Open the README badge, click the failing workflow, find the run. Then:
   - Workflow file changed in last 5 commits? → suspect the workflow.
   - Source code changed? → run the failing job locally if reproducible.
   - Neither? → likely flake or external service. Re-run only the failing job from the GitHub UI.

2. **A workflow I expected to run didn't.** Check `paths-ignore` in the workflow YAML against your diff. If nothing matches, also check `concurrency.cancel-in-progress` — was your push pre-empted by a faster subsequent push?

3. **Compute spend is creeping up.** Run `./scripts/ci-status.sh 7d` and `./scripts/ci-status.sh 24h`. Compare against typical ranges in [docs/ci-budget.md](./ci-budget.md). The first lever is usually CodeQL — see that doc.

4. **Branch protection is blocking a merge.** Look at the **Platform E2E** aggregator status. If it's red while individual shards are green, the aggregator job itself failed — most often because `needs.e2e.result != "success"` due to a cancelled shard. Re-run-cancelled from the UI.
