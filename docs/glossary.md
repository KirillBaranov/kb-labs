# KB Labs Glossary

> **Glossary of terms and concepts used across the KB Labs ecosystem**  
> **Last Updated:** 2025-01-28

## Core Concepts

### Profiles
Project knowledge containers that include rules, ADRs, documentation, and boundaries. Profiles are reusable across products and define project-specific configurations and standards.

**Related:** [ADR-0014: Core Profiles and CLI Integration](./adr/0014-core-profiles-cli-integration.md)

### Artifacts
Files stored in profiles such as rules, handbooks, ADRs, and boundaries. Accessed via the Artifacts API (`list`, `read`, `materialize`).

### Bundle
Complete product configuration loaded via `loadBundle()`, including merged config, profiles, artifacts, and policy. Orchestrated by `@kb-labs/core-bundle`.

### 6-Layer Configuration
Configuration system with layers (from lowest to highest priority):
1. **Runtime** - Default values
2. **Profile** - Profile-specific settings
3. **Preset** - Product preset configurations
4. **Workspace** - Workspace-level settings
5. **Local** - Local developer settings
6. **CLI** - Command-line overrides

**Related:** `@kb-labs/core-config`

### Diff Parsers
Neutral unified-diff AST used in review, tests, and documentation. Provides structured representation of code changes.

**Related:** `@kb-labs/shared-diff`

### Contracts
Stable interfaces for providers, plugins, and telemetry. Defined using TypeScript types and Zod schemas.

**Related:** [ADR-0002: Plugins and Extensibility](./adr/0002-plugins-and-extensibility.md)

### Plugin System
Extensible architecture with isolated, composable, and discoverable plugins. Enables extending functionality without modifying core code.

**Related:** [ADR-0002: Plugins and Extensibility](./adr/0002-plugins-and-extensibility.md)

## Architecture Terms

### Layering Policy
Strict import boundaries between layers:
- **@kb-labs/core** - Infrastructure kernel (no domain logic)
- **@kb-labs/shared** - Shared knowledge layer (no UX/CLI)
- **@kb-labs/ai-*** - Products (depend on core + shared)

**Allowed:** products → shared → core  
**Forbidden:** Reverse dependencies

**Related:** [ADR-0005: Layering & Stability Policy](./adr/0005-layering-stability-police.md)

### Stable API
APIs marked with `@stable` guarantee compatibility across minor releases. Minor releases cannot break `@stable` APIs.

### Experimental API
APIs marked with `@experimental` may change without notice. Use with caution.

### Meta-Workspace
PNPM workspace setup that manages multiple repositories from a single root. Enables cross-repository dependency management.

**Related:** [ADR-0012: PNPM Meta-Workspace Setup](./adr/0012-meta-workspace.md)

## Development Terms

### DevKit
Bootstrap and standards package providing TypeScript configs, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Tsup presets, and GitHub Actions workflows.

**Related:** `@kb-labs/devkit`

### Sync
Automatic synchronization of DevKit configurations to projects. Ensures all projects use consistent tooling standards.

### Drift-Check
Process that detects when local configurations drift from DevKit standards. Flags configuration inconsistencies as errors.

### DevLink
Developer linker that automates local package linking, version sync, and publishing across multiple repositories.

**Related:** `@kb-labs/devlink`

### Watch Mode
Live file watching with automatic rebuild and consumer refresh. Zero manual steps required.

## Quality Terms

### Audit
Unified quality audit framework that combines checks (eslint, tsc, vitest, build, devlink, mind, security) into a single orchestrator.

**Related:** `@kb-labs/audit`

### Quality Gates
Automated enforcement of standards and policies. Prevents releases unless all quality checks pass.

### Contract Tests
Tests that guarantee identical output for canonical fixture repositories across versions.

## Release Terms

### Release Manager
Unified release orchestration that combines audit, devlink, mind checks with version management and publishing.

**Related:** `@kb-labs/release-manager`

### Versioning Policy
Semantic versioning strategy:
- **Major** - Breaking changes
- **Minor** - New features, backward compatible (cannot break `@stable` APIs)
- **Patch** - Bug fixes, backward compatible

**Related:** [ADR-0004: Versioning and Release Policy](./adr/0004-versioning-and-release-policy.md)

## AI Terms

### AI Review
AI-powered code review framework with profile-based rules, dual output (JSON + Markdown), and CI/CD integration.

**Related:** `@kb-labs/ai-review`

### AI Mind
Headless context layer that provides intelligent code indexing, dependency tracking, and context pack generation for AI-powered development workflows.

**Related:** `@kb-labs/mind`

### Context Pack
Structured context packages generated by Mind for consumption by AI tools like Cursor. Optimized for LLM token efficiency.

### TOX (Terse Object eXchange)
Deterministic, compact representation format for structured data optimized for LLM consumption. Provides up to 35% compression.

**Related:** `@kb-labs/tox`

## Process Terms

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
Document that records a significant architectural decision, its context, consequences, and status.

**Related:** [ADR Template](./templates/ADR.template.md)

### Self-Sustaining Ecosystem
Ecosystem that minimizes operational overhead through automation: auto-documentation, auto-indexed ADRs, drift-check, budget monitoring, quality gates.

**Related:** [ADR-0009: Self-Sustaining Engineering Ecosystem](./adr/0009-self-sustaining-engineering-ecosystem.md)

### Automation Survival Constraint
Principle that any manual process must have an automated alternative to ensure ecosystem scalability.

**Related:** [ADR-0013: Automation Survival Constraint](./adr/0013-automation-surival-constraint.md)

## Status Terms

### MVP 1.0
Minimum Viable Product, version 1.0. First stable release of a product.

### Planning
Product is in planning phase, not yet under active development.

### In Progress
Product is currently under active development.

### Beta
Product is in beta testing phase.

### Stable
Product is stable and production-ready.
