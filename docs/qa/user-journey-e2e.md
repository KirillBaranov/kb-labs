# User-journey E2E contract

The normative scenarios are documented in
[`user-journey-scenarios.md`](./user-journey-scenarios.md). This document
describes their automation layers and release wiring.

KB Labs E2E has two layers:

1. **Technical suites** — endpoint, schema, adapter, and service tests. They
   answer whether one subsystem behaves correctly.
2. **User journeys** — release gates that answer whether a user can install
   KB Labs, configure it, start it, and reach a useful result.

Technical suites are useful diagnostics, but they are not a substitute for a
user journey. A user-journey test must fail when any step is unavailable,
silently skipped, or reports success without leaving the next required
artifact.

## Canonical first-value journey

The main source/CI E2E runs the deterministic V2 contract journey. The
post-publish V2 E2E consumes the sealed release-index and exact public
artifacts:

```text
kb-create apply + sealed release-index
  → fresh platform/project roots
  → generated receipt, config and project pointer
  → kb CLI and kb-dev
  → all services alive and reachable
  → human login + service-account registration
  → marketplace list/install through the CLI
  → scaffold a plugin
  → install/build/run the plugin
  → lint shipped workflow templates
  → submit workflow
  → observe terminal status and logs
  → update without losing plugins or credentials
```

The journey is intentionally outcome-oriented. Every arrow is a required
transition. A missing binary, a missing auth header, an invalid shipped
workflow, a non-discoverable command, or a run that never reaches a terminal
state is a failure.

The release suite is not limited to this first-value path. The full scenario
catalog also covers:

- safe platform update and confirmed platform removal without deleting project
  artifacts;
- installing, switching, exercising, and removing adapters;
- adding, editing, running, inspecting, and removing workflows;
- isolated platform/project directories and clean CI installation.

## Test layers and responsibilities

| Layer | Purpose | Example command |
|---|---|---|
| Unit/integration | Diagnose a subsystem quickly | `pnpm --filter ... test` |
| Domain E2E | Exercise a running service or plugin domain | `kb-devkit run e2e --packages @kb-labs/e2e-workflows` |
| Launcher journey | Exercise V2 request/apply/status/plugin/workflow flow | `go test ./v2/e2e/...` |
| Domain user journeys | Exercise services, marketplace, adapters and workflow examples | `kb-devkit run e2e --packages @kb-labs/e2e-workflows` |
| Post-publish smoke | Exercise published V2 artifacts and release-index | `make e2e-release-smoke` |

## No silent skips

Domain E2E may skip a suite when the domain is not part of that platform
fixture. The canonical user journey may not skip prerequisites. In particular:

- missing `kb-create`, `kb`, `kb-dev`, or install manifest is a failure;
- failed service startup or unreachable health endpoint is a failure;
- auth login succeeding while marketplace returns 401 is a failure;
- an incomplete install must have a non-zero exit code;
- workflow lint and workflow execution must be checked explicitly;
- a command is not considered available until it runs from the documented
  user project context.

## Release gate policy

The release journey must run against published artifacts, not only local
source builds. It is required after binary/npm delivery and on a scheduled
cadence. The job must upload its complete step log on failure and must fail the
workflow when the journey itself fails; a green health check or a green domain
suite cannot override a red user journey.
