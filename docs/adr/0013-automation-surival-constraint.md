# ADR-0013: Automation as a Survival Constraint

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** KB Labs Team  

## Context

KB Labs is developed in a high-throughput, single-founder mode. Manual operations (repetitive builds, hand-written docs, ad-hoc validation, release rituals) would drain time and focus away from product innovation.

Since the ecosystem aims to cover multiple products (AI Review, AI Docs, AI Tests, AI Assistant, Studio, etc.), scaling by adding more manual work is not viable. The only sustainable option is to automate every repeatable workflow, even in the early stage.

## Decision

Automation is treated as a hard survival constraint of the KB Labs ecosystem:

### Core Principles
1. **Every critical workflow must be automated** (CI, schema validation, profile checks, docs generation, budgets, analytics)
2. **Self-validation is mandatory**: The system must be able to detect and signal drift, misconfiguration, or schema errors without human intervention
3. **Human effort is invested only once**: Any repeated step must be codified into reusable tools (DevKit, reusable workflows, presets)
4. **Automation is the default priority**: When evaluating features, automation is not "nice to have" but the baseline expectation

This principle ensures that the platform scales linearly in value, not in maintenance cost.

## Rationale

- **Sustainability**: Enables single maintainer to sustain multi-product ecosystem
- **Efficiency**: Reduces operational overhead, freeing energy for innovation
- **Credibility**: Builds trust for external adoption through predictable systems
- **Consistency**: Creates uniform pipelines across all KB Labs projects
- **Scalability**: Platform value grows without proportional maintenance cost increase

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enables one person (founder/maintainer) to sustain a multi-product ecosystem
- Reduces operational overhead, freeing energy for architecture, vision, and product
- Builds credibility for external adoption (companies trust predictable, automated systems)
- Creates consistent pipelines across all KB Labs projects
- Linear scaling in value without maintenance cost growth

**Negative:**
- Higher upfront investment in infrastructure (DevKit, CI, reusable workflows)
- Sometimes automation takes longer initially than a one-off manual action
- Requires strict discipline to avoid shortcuts
- Initial complexity in setting up automated systems

## Implementation

### Already Applied
- **CI pipelines** (lint, typecheck, drift check, test, coverage)
- **Profiles validation** and schemas enforcement
- **DevKit reusable workflows** for consistent development

### Next Steps
- Expand automation to docs (AI Docs pipeline)
- Budget and token usage tracking via Studio
- Continuous insight generation (analytics, trends)
- Automated release and deployment pipelines

## Alternatives Considered

- **Partial automation / manual fallback** — rejected (accumulates hidden operational debt)
- **Rely on future contributors** — rejected (assumes survival in single-maintainer mode)
- **Manual-first approach** — rejected (not scalable for multi-product ecosystem)

## Follow-ups

- Document automation patterns and best practices
- Create automation templates for new products
- Establish metrics for automation effectiveness
- Regular review of manual processes for automation opportunities
- Build automation-first culture in development workflows
