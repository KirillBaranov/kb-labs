# ADR-0009: Self-Sustaining Engineering Ecosystem

**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Deciders:** KB Labs Team  

## Context

KB Labs is building an ecosystem that minimizes operational overhead and scales independently: auto-documentation, auto-indexed ADRs, drift-check, budget monitoring, security scans, quality gates, and agents for migrations/tests/docs.

The goal is to create a self-sustaining engineering environment where repetitive tasks are automated, quality is enforced by default, and the system can evolve with minimal manual intervention.

## Decision

We establish a self-sustaining engineering ecosystem based on the following vision and principles:

### Core Principles
- **Automate-by-default**: All repetitive tasks go into CI/scripts/agents
- **Single Source of Truth**: Tooling and presets centralized in @kb-labs/devkit
- **Drift is a bug**: Config/documentation drift is a red flag with auto-checking in CI
- **Observable Engineering**: Metrics for quality, cost (AI/CI), and velocity
- **Docs as a Product**: ADRs/READMEs/Wiki are generated and indexed automatically
- **Pluggable Everything**: Plugins for analytics, storage, providers, and agents
- **Budget Guardrails**: Limits/alerts/ratings for AI operation costs

### Implementation Strategy
- **Automation First**: Every manual process should have an automated alternative
- **Quality Gates**: Automated enforcement of standards and policies
- **Cost Control**: Built-in monitoring and limits for AI tool usage
- **Documentation**: Self-updating and self-indexing documentation system

## Rationale

- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces manual overhead and human error
- **Scalability**: System can grow without proportional increase in maintenance
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated enforcement ensures consistent standards
- **Cost Predictability**: Built-in monitoring prevents budget overruns
- **Developer Experience**: Focus on high-value work rather than repetitive tasks

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reduces operational costs and increases quality predictability
- Enables independent scaling with minimal manual intervention
- Provides consistent developer experience across all projects
- Built-in cost control and quality enforcement

**Negative:**
- Requires discipline in conventions and maintaining DevKit as source of truth
- Initial complexity in setting up automation systems
- Learning curve for contributors to understand automated workflows

## Implementation Roadmap

The following components will be implemented via separate ADRs:

- **ADR Indexer** (INDEX.md + index.json + stale-scan)
- **Drift-check & auto-PRs** for configuration consistency
- **AI budget monitor** (Cursor/LLM usage, monthly caps)
- **Security & license scans** with automated remediation
- **Docs pipelines** (README/CHANGELOG/wiki sync)
- **Quality gates** (coverage/linters/types as policies)

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual processes** — rejected (not scalable, error-prone)
- **External tools only** — rejected (loses control, increases dependencies)
- **Minimal automation** — rejected (doesn't achieve self-sustaining goals)

## Follow-ups

- Create detailed implementation ADRs for each component
- Establish automation metrics and success criteria
- Set up monitoring dashboards for system health
- Create contributor guidelines for working with automated systems
