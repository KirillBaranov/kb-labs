/**
 * Plan resolution shared by the atomic release steps that must act on the
 * SAME plan (`release:version` → `release:git`).
 *
 * Why this exists: each step used to call planRelease() independently and
 * hope the results matched. They don't have to — planning is a function of
 * disk state, and the step in between mutates exactly that state. A plan
 * re-derived after `release:version` sees the bumped versions as the new
 * baseline and bumps again, so the tag/commit message end up one version
 * ahead of the package.json files actually being committed.
 *
 * The plan written by `release:plan` is the single source of truth for a
 * pipeline run. It is only reused when it provably describes the current
 * state of the working tree, so a stale artifact (plan.json is committed to
 * the repo, so one is always present) can never be adopted silently.
