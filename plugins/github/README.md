## Workflow Handlers

This plugin registers workflow handlers — use them in KB Labs workflow definitions:

**Example workflow step:**

```yaml
steps:
  - id: fetch-issue
    handler: github/fetch-issue
    input:
      owner: my-org
      repo: my-repo
      issue: 42

  - id: create-pr
    handler: github/create-pr
    input:
      owner: my-org
      repo: my-repo
