## Overview

Infra Worker is the execution-plane provisioning plugin. It is called by the
workflow engine and other orchestrators when they need to prepare an isolated
execution environment: materialize a workspace from a source ref, spin up an
environment container, and optionally capture or restore a snapshot. Not
intended for direct user invocation.

---

## Features

- Materialize workspace from any source reference
- Provision environment with configurable template and TTL
- Capture and restore snapshots for fast environment reuse
- Garbage collection for expired snapshot namespaces
- Full permissions over workspace, environment, and snapshot platform APIs

---

## Requirements

**KB Labs platform** `>= 0.1.0`

Platform permissions required: `environment` (create/read/destroy), `workspace` (materialize/attach/release), `snapshot` (capture/restore/delete/gc).

---

## Installation

```bash
pnpm kb marketplace install @kb-labs/infra-worker-entry
```

---

## Commands

> These commands are designed for orchestrator use. In normal workflows they
> are invoked automatically by the execution plane — not by hand.

```bash
kb infra-worker prepare \
  --sourceRef main \
  --createEnvironment --templateId docker-node \
  --captureSnapshot --namespace my-ns

kb infra-worker capture-snapshot \
  --workspaceId ws-123 \
  --namespace my-ns

kb infra-worker restore-snapshot \
  --snapshotId snap-abc \
  --workspaceId ws-123 \
  --overwrite
```
