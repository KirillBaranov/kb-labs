## Overview

Marketplace is both a CLI plugin and a daemon (`:5070`). The CLI commands let
you install packages from the registry, manage the lock file, and control which
plugins are active in your workspace. The daemon hosts the registry API used by
Studio and other services.

---

## Features

- Install, uninstall, and update marketplace packages
- Lock-file-based reproducibility — `sync` restores exact installed state
- Enable / disable plugins without uninstalling
- Link local plugins for development
- CLI discovery cache management
- Diagnostic doctor for plugin issues
